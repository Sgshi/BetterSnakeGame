# BetterSnakeGame
Classic snake game with custom artwork and a twist. The "apples" move and the snake lives near a dangerous high traffic freeway.

## Motivation
Want to learn how to code, and how to code really well. Thought this would be a natural progression from my first basic game, future projects will be focused away from gui and more towards more technical aspects

## Build status
Finished project. Future considerations would be a random level selector and two different levels.
KITCHEN - snake moves around a kitchen and needs to avoid a vacuum cleaner
DESERT - snake lives in desert with multiple highways and vultures that drop randomly, use shadows to know where it is around.

other small details that need to be added:
-the snake body is still using a placeholder, needs to be dynamic based on the direction of the body and how it is turning
-the snake head has an eating animation and also a secondary sprite that can alternate with the current sprite to add movement, currently not implemented
-mice should have alternative sprite to represent movement
-MUSIC SHOULD BE ADDED
-opening window should be added

KNOWN BUGS
-it is currently possible to make the snake move back into itself if direction keys are pressed in succession quickly enough
-testerwindow only works on the first instance of BetterSnakeGame

## Tech/framework used
Built in Java using Swing for GUI

## Installation
I have it working from compiler, you'll have to change the SnakeLogic.filePath location to match where the program is.

## Credits
Figured most of this out myself, used some youtube videos here and there.
